# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve iOS Local LLM.

## Before you start

- Search existing issues and pull requests.
- Open an issue before a large architectural change.
- Keep changes focused and explain the user-facing effect.
- Do not add model weights, generated frameworks, signing files, credentials,
  or third-party material without a reviewed redistribution license.

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repository and clone it with submodules.
2. Create a branch from `main`.
3. Follow [SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md).
4. Add or update tests for behavior changes.
5. Run the relevant tests and `./scripts/validate_open_source.sh`.
6. Sign off each commit with `git commit -s` to certify the
   [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).
7. Open a pull request using the repository template.

## Code style

- Follow the surrounding Swift and SwiftUI conventions.
- Prefer small, testable types and explicit error handling.
- Keep UI work accessible with Dynamic Type and VoiceOver.
- Avoid unrelated formatting or generated-project churn.
- Update `project.yml` before regenerating the Xcode project.
