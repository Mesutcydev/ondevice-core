// MARK: - SpeechDictationService
// Wraps SFSpeechRecognizer + AVAudioEngine. Two operating modes:
//
//   Single-shot (chat composer):
//     start { transcript, isFinal in … }   // default continuous = false
//     The recognizer's first `isFinal` tears the audio graph down and
//     deactivates the shared AVAudioSession.
//
//   Continuous (voice-conversation):
//     start(continuous: true) { transcript, _ in … }
//     The audio engine + tap stay alive across recognizer phrase boundaries.
//     Internally we just rotate to a fresh recognition request when the
//     recognizer declares isFinal, so background noise can no longer cause
//     a stop/restart cycle. The caller owns the audio session lifecycle —
//     SpeechDictationService.cleanup() does NOT setActive(false) in this
//     mode, letting the parent service keep `.playAndRecord` hot for the
//     TTS that comes next.
//
//   pauseRecognition() / resumeRecognition()
//     For continuous mode. Ends the current SFSpeechRecognizer request so
//     the mic stops transcribing (for example, while we're speaking to the
//     user via TTS — otherwise we'd transcribe our own output back into the
//     next user turn). The audio engine keeps running so level metering
//     remains available for the orb UI.
