// Persisted, on-device "arena" for head-to-head model votes. The A/B
// compare surfaces (CompareView for text, VisualModelComparisonView for
// images) let the user run one prompt against two models and pick a
// winner. Before this store the verdict evaporated the moment the sheet
// closed — the compare header literally said "pick a winner" with no way
// to record one. This makes the vote durable: every match updates an Elo
// rating and a win/loss/tie tally, producing a per-device leaderboard
// that's the thing people actually open a model-testing app to build.
//
// Why Elo and not just win-rate: win-rate alone over-rewards a model that
// only ever faced weak opponents. Elo discounts a win against a model the
// user already rates low and rewards an upset, so the ranking stays honest
// as the user pits stronger models against each other over time. Win/loss
// counts are kept alongside for a plain-language summary.
//
// Lanes keep modalities separate. Comparing a text LLM's Elo against a
// vision VLM's Elo is meaningless — they never play each other — so each
// lane is an independent rating pool with its own leaderboard.
