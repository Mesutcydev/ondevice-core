# Changelog

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and intends to use semantic version tags for source releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Sideload build 110 restores the OnDevice LLM display name and preserves the
  share extension's application-group entitlement during ad-hoc packaging.
- Imported GGUF assistants now receive their chat template, sampler
  settings, and system/tool prompts. Recurrent Gemma 3n / Gemma 4 E-series
  keep the compact 512/128 workaround; dense Gemma 4 12B/31B do not.
- MLX seed, frequency penalty, and presence penalty settings are applied.
- Local API chat/responses/messages replies report real token usage.
- Truncated replies are labeled in the chat chrome; the compact GGUF
  128-token cap is visible on the token-cap chip.
- Release-styled app builds no longer embed the unit-test bundle.
- Chat prompts no longer invite invented tool results, citations, or live
  data. Gemma templates fold the system prompt into the first user turn
  once instead of duplicating it.
- Standard GGUF assistants no longer inherit the smaller MLX-family output
  cap; Ornith continuation resumes at the correct KV-cache position.
- Speculative model prefetch now runs only after model load while charging and
  thermally nominal, reducing idle disk work and phone heat.

### Added

- In-chat streaming, approval, running-tool, citation, and image-generation
  cards. Web/file tool consent stays in the transcript.
- True Continue: tap Continue or the cut-off chip to resume the same
  assistant turn. Standard GGUFs reuse the live KV when it is still
  resident; otherwise the open assistant turn is re-prefills. No fake
  "please continue" user message.
- Standard imported GGUFs reuse matching prompt-prefix KV across turns
  instead of clearing the cache every send. Compact Gemma 3n / E-series
  still recreate context.

  SBOM, and coding-agent documentation.
