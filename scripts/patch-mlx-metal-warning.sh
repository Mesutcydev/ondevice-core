# Xcode 26.5 compiles mlx-swift 0.31.4's generated Metal source as a
# pre-C++17 dialect and emits four warnings for valid `if constexpr` uses.
# Swift package targets do not inherit MTL_COMPILER_FLAGS from the app project,
# so apply the narrow diagnostic suppression directly to the resolved source.
# The checkout may be recreated by package resolution; this script is therefore
# idempotent and runs as a scheme pre-action before every build.
