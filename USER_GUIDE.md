# iOS Local LLM User Guide — Complete On-Device AI Workspace Manual

Welcome to the **iOS Local LLM User Guide**. This document serves as a comprehensive manual detailing every tab, menu, setting, and feature of iOS Local LLM.

iOS Local LLM is a local-first, privacy-respecting AI studio built specifically for macOS and iOS. It runs third-party language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) directly on your device's hardware using Apple's **MLX framework**, Core ML, and local native runtimes. It requires no iOS Local LLM account and includes no project-operated telemetry. Model downloads, optional web search, iCloud sync, and local bridge features use the network only when you enable or request them.

## 1. Core Features & Architecture

iOS Local LLM is designed to maximize local hardware capabilities while maintaining a strict zero-data-collection posture.

### Technology Blueprint
* **Inference Engine**: Employs the Apple MLX Swift wrapper for native Apple Silicon optimization, allowing LLMs (like Qwen 2.5 Coder or Llama 3.2) and VLMs (like SmolVLM 2.2B) to execute at maximum tokens-per-second on-device.
* **Unified Model Residency**: Uses an automatic unload/load cycle during tab changes. Large language models and vision models are loaded on-demand and unloaded when leaving tabs (e.g., swapping to Lens unloads the Chat LLM) to prevent memory allocation overruns (exceeding iOS's 6 GB jetsam ceiling).
* **Metal/GPU Safety**: Listens to app lifecycle states (`willResignActive` & backgrounding) to immediately suspend active GPU queue submissions, preventing background execution violations that trigger system termination.

---

## 2. Home Tab: Dashboard & Status Hub

The **Home Tab** acts as the launchpad and central status dashboard for iOS Local LLM.

### Main Functions
* **Greeting & Quick-Launch Hero Card**: Surfaces a real-time status of the loaded Assistant Model (e.g., *Ready*, *Thinking*, *Preparing*, or *Needs Setup*). Allows starting a **New Chat** or accessing **Voice mode** with a single tap.
* **Quick Action Grid**: Quick shortcuts to deep link into the **Lens** (camera), **Voice** (dictation), or **Mac** (pairing sheet) views.
* **Recent Conversations**: Lists the last three active chat threads with titles and relative time stamps, allowing you to jump back into a conversation.
* **Privacy Summary Card**: Displays the number of downloaded models and total local storage usage on your device, with a direct link to the **Models Hub**.
* **Settings Gear Access**: The avatar/gear icon in the top-right opens the application preferences.

## 3. Assistant Tab: Interactive Chat & Power Tools

The **Assistant Tab** is a fully-featured local chat interface powered by your choice of on-device LLM.

![Assistant Tab Landing View](IOSLocalLLM/ss/4.PNG)
*Figure 1: The Assistant tab home view, presenting a clean landing interface with model status indicator and quick starting cards.*

### Landing Interface vs. Active Chat
* **Landing Route**: Welcomes you with a clean interface displaying the currently active model (e.g., `Qwen3-4B`), suggestion cards (e.g., *"Explain a complex topic"* or *"Identify what this code does"*), and a collapsed **Ask anything...** pill.
* **Chat Route**: Standard message bubbles featuring markdown formatting, syntax highlighting for code blocks, and inline buttons.

### Message & Bubble Actions
* **Copy Text**: Copies the plain text content of any message.
* **Edit & Resend**: Prefills your input editor with a previous user prompt so you can refine and resend.
* **Regenerate**: Discards the last assistant turn and re-runs generation using the same context.
* **Follow-up Chips**: Displays quick follow-up prompt templates at the end of the final assistant response (e.g., *"Explain more"*, *"Shorter version"*, *"Format as code"*).

### Composer Input & Attachments Bar
* **Voice Dictation**: Tap the mic button to speak your prompt instead of typing.
* **Photo Picker**: Attach one or more images for vision models to analyze.
* **Document Picker**: Attach text files, log files, or code repositories to inspect.
* **Snippet Manager**: Access a card listing saved prompt templates to quickly insert boilerplate text into the input field.

### Interactive Chat Overflow Options
Click the ellipsis icon (`...`) in the top right to access advanced power tools:
1. **Voice Conversation**: Full-screen hands-free talk interface.
2. **Image Generation**: Generates high-quality images locally on your device (see details below).
3. **Past Conversations**: Swap between saved chats, search conversation histories, or export chat threads to markdown files.
4. **Mac Bridge Status**: Inspect paired Mac connection latency or trigger a ping request.
5. **Persona Selector**: Swap active system instructions (e.g., switching between a *Software Engineer*, *Technical Educator*, or *System Administrator*).
6. **Web Search Options**: Toggle the web browsing agent (Web Tool) on/off or configure confirmation rules.
7. **Model Benchmarks**: Run performance suites to measure hardware limits.
8. **A/B Model Comparison**: Test two models side-by-side.
9. **Macros Runner**: Execute multi-prompt chains sequentially (e.g., `Review Code` ➔ `Write Tests` ➔ `Format`).

### On-Device Image Generation
iOS Local LLM features a fully local image generation engine that fits within iOS memory budgets, avoiding heavy, server-only engines like FLUX in favor of highly optimized SD 1.5, SDXL Turbo, and Stable Diffusion models.

| Image Generation Prompting | Advanced Options |
|---|---|
| ![Image Prompting](IOSLocalLLM/ss/1.PNG) <br> *Figure 2: Writing a text prompt for image generation.* | ![Image Generation Settings](IOSLocalLLM/ss/3.PNG) <br> *Figure 3: Image generation model selector (e.g., DreamShaper 8) and advanced settings.* |

* **Model Options**: Pick models like `DreamShaper 8` (Lykon/dreamshaper-8 SD 1.5 fine-tune) optimized to generate images under strict local RAM limits.
* **Advanced Adjustments**: Define **negative prompts** (elements to avoid) and adjust the generation **steps** slider (higher values add detail but require more processing time).
* **Export**: Generated images can be saved to your photo library or shared via standard iOS share sheets.
